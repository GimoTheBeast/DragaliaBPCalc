# Explanation of Skill Haste & Breakpoints
Whenever a character does anything that has some form of skill point increase attatched to it (such as performing a combo 
by tapping or using the character's force strike), their skills/gauge (depending on the character) fill
by a certain number depending on the attack. You can use the Skill Haste effect to increase the SP gained 
by a %. If something would fill a skill by 100 SP, then 15% Skill Haste would make that 115 SP, for example.

However, Skill Haste is only effective if it actually reduces the number of hits it takes to fully fill a skill.
If a skill has 5000 SP (using sword's c2 > fs combo as an example), the first breakpoint is at 4% skill haste.
This means that any skill haste from 1-3% would have no effect on making this skill come out faster. This concept
applies to all breakpoints for this combo (at 4%,7%,11%,20%,25% and so on), any percent of skill haste between those numbers
would have no effect.
